# Roll The Dice
### Small College Game Project

a Game/Project for College that uses basic object orientation and parameter passing

###Initial Game Mechanics:
This is a single player game. The dice is placed on the tbale with a value of 1 showing on the dice face. The player starts with a score of 5. The player then throws the dice. If the dice face is a 6 then the game is over and the player has a score of 5. On the other hand if the dice face is not 6 then the player loses one point and throws again. This process continues until either the player has thrown a 6 or the player's score has become equal to 0.

###Any Extra Stuff:
Nothing really. The game can handle multiple dice (Which was a funny accident), and thankfully also, maybe, supports multi-player stuff (Not that it's necessary for this project)
